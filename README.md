# CSE310-FALL-2022

Hi everyone! I'm JC. I'm a professional .NET backend developer. I'm also a hobbyist video game dev who primarily focuses on Unity, but I'm looking to pick up Unreal Engine.
I really enjoy so many aspects of software development. I've been playing around with breadboard circuits to teach myself logic gates, I've been poking around with
deep learning AI, and I taught myself Python a couple years ago so that I could teach the language as an instructor for Delaware STEAM Academy, just to name a few different things.

I'm not supposed to say this, but I am doing this project/repo for a college class. See, I've done a lot in my life that I'm proud of. I have been supremely blessed
with a wonderful wife, a good job, and decent health. But something I've always regretted was not finishing that college degree. More importantly, I desire the 
extra job security that a degree provides. I've been poor before. It sucks, and I'll do whatever it takes to ensure my wife never has to worry about finances again.

So, I am back in college. I'd love to have anyone who finds this to come along for the ride with me. My goal for this class is to really stretch my skillset. To that end,
I've decided to pick up C++ again to learn Unreal Engine and really dive deep into some more nitty-gritty subjects. I'd love to do a basic project writing in DirectX 12.
It's been a few years since I last touched C++, so my first goal is to just reacquaint myself with the syntax and memory management.

Each project in this repo will have its own readme with more specific information explaining each one. I may adjust my repo structure at a later point,
as I have been given a bit more freedom to choose how I structure my projects for this course.

# Project List
